# Optional Celery SSL/TLS config snippet for production
# Used if you want your Celery worker/beat to connect to a broker (e.g., Redis/RabbitMQ) over SSL
# Reference these environment variables in your docker-compose or .env as needed

# Example environment variables for SSL (RabbitMQ):
# CELERY_BROKER_USE_SSL=true
# CELERY_BROKER_SSL_CERTFILE=/certs/client.crt
# CELERY_BROKER_SSL_KEYFILE=/certs/client.key
# CELERY_BROKER_SSL_CA_CERTS=/certs/ca.crt

# Example environment variables for SSL (Redis):
# REDIS_SSL=true
# REDIS_SSL_CERT_REQS=required
# REDIS_SSL_CA_CERTS=/certs/ca.crt
# REDIS_SSL_KEYFILE=/certs/client.key
# REDIS_SSL_CERTFILE=/certs/client.crt
